1. Using Console - Console means Javascript.
--> Console uses the concept of REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop).

It has four steps :
(i). Read : It reads the input from the user.
(ii). Evaluate : It calculate or compute the expression defined by the user like addition, subtraction etc. 
(iii). Print : It prints the output on the console like if we write 1 on the console then it will print 1 only and if we write 1 + 2 on the console then it will print 3 on the console.
(iv). Loop : Loop makes sure that the whole process is repeated until the user stops giving input.

2. Variables - A variable is simply a name of the storage location.
For Ex : age = 23;
here age is a variable and 23 is the value of the variable.

3. Datatypes in JS 
--> There are two types of datatypes in JS - Primitive and Non-Primitive.
(i). Primitive Datatypes 
a. Numbers - positive, negative, integers, floating numbers with decimal. In JavaScript, there is a limit on the numbers which means that if we take a number like 0.999999999999 then it will convert into the nearest integer number which in this case will be 1.
b. Strings
c. Boolean - Boolean represents a truth value -> true or false / yes or no.
d. undefined - A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined.
e. null - The null value represents the intentional absence of any object value. To be explicitly assigned.
f. Bigint
g. Symbol

4. Operations 
--> addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, Exponential power operator.  
For Ex : a + b;
here a and b are operands and + is a operator.

5. NaN in JS (Not a Number)
--> The NaN global property is a value representing Not-a-Number.
It means it represents those number which are mathematically invalid like (0/0).

6. Opertor Precedence
--> This is the general order of solving an expression.
The order is : (i). ()
               (ii). **
               (iii). */%
               (iv). +-

7. let keyword(keywords are reserved words) 
--> Syntax of declaring Variables

8. const keyword 
--> values of constants can't be changed with re-assignment & they can't be re-declare.

9. var keyword
--> Old Syntax of writing Variables.

10. Practice Qs 
(i). What is the value of age after this code runs?
let age = 23;
age + 2; // after 2 years

(ii). What is the value of avg after this code runs?
let hindi = 80;
let eng = 90;
 let math = 100;
 let avg = (hindi + eng + math) / 3;
 
 (iii). What is the value of each variable in each line of code?
 let num = 5;
 let newNum = num++;
 newNum = ++num;

 11. Indentifier Rules 
 --> All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names (Indentifiers).
 a. Names can contain letters, digits, underscore, and dollar signs. (no space).
 b. Names must beign with a letter.
 c. Names can also begin with $ and _.
 d. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
 e. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) CANNOT be used as names.

 12. camelCase 
 --> Way of writing Indentifiers
 camelCase (JS nameing convention)
 snake_case and PascalCase.

13. What is TypeScript? 
--> TypeScript is sort of next version of JavaScript which is now used by many companies.
The difference between JavaScript and Typescript is about Typed.
For Ex : In TypeScript, if you define a = 5; which is a number. then you cannot define a = true, which is a string so you can't change the datatype of any variable in Typescript. But in JS , you can.
Typescript is Static Typed means fixed, where JS is dynamic Typed means can be change (Designed by Microsoft).

14. String in JS
--> Strings are text or sequence of characters. It is used within the single or double quotes.

15. String indices (index)
--> Javascript, c++, Java are the 0 based indexing language which means index begins with 0 in these leanguages.

16. Concatenation in String 
--> adding strings together 


17. Practice Qs of JS part-1
(i). Declare your name as a string and print its length in JS.
(ii). Declare your first anme as a string and print its first character. 
(iii). Declare your first name as a string and print its last character. 
(iv). What is the output of following code: 
"apnacollege" + 123 ;
(v). What are lengths of an empty string & a string with a single space?
