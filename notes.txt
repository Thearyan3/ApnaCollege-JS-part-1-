1. Using Console - Console means Javascript.
--> Console uses the concept of REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop).

It has four steps :
(i). Read : It reads the input from the user.
(ii). Evaluate : It calculate or compute the expression defined by the user like addition, subtraction etc. 
(iii). Print : It prints the output on the console like if we write 1 on the console then it will print 1 only and if we write 1 + 2 on the console then it will print 3 on the console.
(iv). Loop : Loop makes sure that the whole process is repeated until the user stops giving input.

2. Variables - A variable is simply a name of the storage location.
For Ex : age = 23;
here age is a variable and 23 is the value of the variable.

3. Datatypes in JS 
--> There are two types of datatypes in JS - Primitive and Non-Primitive.
(i). Primitive Datatypes 
a. Numbers - positive, negative, integers, floating numbers with decimal. In JavaScript, there is a limit on the numbers which means that if we take a number like 0.999999999999 then it will convert into the nearest integer number which in this case will be 1.
b. Strings
c. Boolean
d. undefined
e. null
f. Bigint
g. Symbol

4. Operations 
--> addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, Exponential power operator.  
For Ex : a + b;
here a and b are operands and + is a operator.

5. NaN in JS (Not a Number)
--> The NaN global property is a value representing Not-a-Number.
It means it represents those number which are mathematically invalid like (0/0).

6. Opertor Precedence
--> This is the general order of solving an expression.
The order is : (i). ()
               (ii). **
               (iii). */%
               (iv). +-

7. let keyword(keywords are reserved words) 
--> Syntax of declaring Variables

8. const keyword 
--> values of constants can't be changed with re-assignment & they can't be re-declare.

9. var keyword
--> Old Syntax of writing Variables.

10. Practice Qs 
(i). What is the value of age after this code runs?
let age = 23;
age + 2; // after 2 years

(ii). What is the value of avg after this code runs?
let hindi = 80;
let eng = 90;
 let math = 100;
 let avg = (hindi + eng + math) / 3;
 
 (iii). What is the value of each variable in each line of code?
 let num = 5;
 let newNum = num++;
 newNum = ++num;

 11. Indentifier Rules 
 --> All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names (Indentifiers).
 a. Names can contain letters, digits, underscore, and dollar signs. (no space).
 b. Names must beign with a letter.
 c. Names can also begin with $ and _.
 d. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
 e. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) CANNOT be used as names.

 12. camelCase 
 --> Way of writing Indentifiers
 camelCase (JS nameing convention)
 snake_case and PascalCase.
