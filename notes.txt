1. Using Console - Console means Javascript.
--> Console uses the concept of REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop).

It has four steps :
(i). Read : It reads the input from the user.
(ii). Evaluate : It calculate or compute the expression defined by the user like addition, subtraction etc. 
(iii). Print : It prints the output on the console like if we write 1 on the console then it will print 1 only and if we write 1 + 2 on the console then it will print 3 on the console.
(iv). Loop : Loop makes sure that the whole process is repeated until the user stops giving input.

2. Variables - A variable is simply a name of the storage location.
For Ex : age = 23;
here age is a variable and 23 is the value of the variable.

3. Datatypes in JS 
--> There are two types of datatypes in JS - Primitive and Non-Primitive.
(i). Primitive Datatypes 
a. Numbers - positive, negative, integers, floating numbers with decimal. In JavaScript, there is a limit on the numbers which means that if we take a number like 0.999999999999 then it will convert into the nearest integer number which in this case will be 1.
b. Strings
c. Boolean
d. undefined
e. null
f. Bigint
g. Symbol

4. Operations 
--> addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, Exponential power operator.  
For Ex : a + b;
here a and b are operands and + is a operator.
